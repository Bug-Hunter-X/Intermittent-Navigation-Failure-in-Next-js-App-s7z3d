# Next.js Navigation Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in a Next.js application related to navigation between pages.  Specifically, navigating from a page to the home page (`/`) using `router.push('/')` sometimes fails, resulting in a blank page or an unexpected rendering. 

## Bug Description
The navigation issue occurs intermittently. It is likely a client-side routing problem that is not consistently reproducible, making debugging challenging. The problem might stem from asynchronous operations or race conditions during page transitions.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about`.
5. Click the "Go back Home" button.
6. Observe whether the home page (`/`) renders correctly.  Repeat steps 4-6 multiple times to observe the intermittent nature of the bug.

## Potential Solutions
The solution might involve optimizing asynchronous operations, adding error handling, or exploring alternative navigation methods like `router.replace()` to better manage the client-side routing state.  Further investigation may be needed to pinpoint the root cause.
